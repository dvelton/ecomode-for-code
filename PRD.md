# EcoMode for Code - Product Requirements Document

Help developers reduce their code's environmental impact through intelligent refactoring suggestions that optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon footprint.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Mission-driven** - Users should feel empowered to make a meaningful environmental impact through code optimization
2. **Insightful** - Clear, actionable analysis that transforms complex energy concepts into understandable developer recommendations  
3. **Professional** - Clean, trustworthy interface that developers can confidently use in their workflow

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Combines GitHub repository analysis with energy impact calculations and presents actionable refactoring suggestions with persistent user preferences

## Essential Features

**Repository Input & Analysis**
- Functionality: Accept GitHub repository URLs and perform static code analysis to identify energy-inefficient patterns
- Purpose: Enable developers to understand their code's environmental impact without complex setup
- Trigger: User pastes GitHub repository URL and clicks "Analyze Repository"
- Progression: URL input → repository validation → code analysis → results display
- Success criteria: Successfully parses repository, identifies at least 3 categories of inefficiencies, completes analysis within 30 seconds

**Eco Impact Dashboard**
- Functionality: Display estimated environmental and cost savings across different usage scales with visual charts
- Purpose: Quantify the real-world impact of code optimizations in terms developers and stakeholders understand
- Trigger: Automatically generated after code analysis completes
- Progression: Analysis completion → impact calculation → dashboard rendering → scale selection
- Success criteria: Shows carbon, water, energy, and cost metrics for 100/10k/1M run scenarios with clear units

**Refactoring Suggestions Panel**
- Functionality: Present specific code improvements with before/after examples and individual impact estimates
- Purpose: Provide actionable guidance that developers can immediately implement
- Trigger: Displays alongside impact dashboard after analysis
- Progression: Code analysis → suggestion generation → code diff presentation → copy/export options
- Success criteria: Each suggestion shows original code, refactored version, and quantified savings

**Settings & Customization**
- Functionality: Allow users to adjust analysis parameters like cloud provider, region, and usage frequency assumptions
- Purpose: Provide personalized impact estimates based on actual deployment scenarios
- Trigger: User clicks settings/preferences in header
- Progression: Settings access → parameter adjustment → recalculation → updated results
- Success criteria: Changes persist between sessions and immediately update all calculations

## Edge Case Handling

- **Private repositories**: Clear messaging about public repository requirement with GitHub authentication option
- **Large repositories**: Progress indicators and timeout handling with partial analysis results  
- **Unsupported languages**: Graceful degradation with generic suggestions and clear language support status
- **Network failures**: Retry mechanisms with offline mode for previously analyzed repositories
- **Invalid URLs**: Real-time validation with helpful format examples and error recovery

## Design Direction

The design should evoke environmental consciousness and technical precision - clean energy vibes that feel both hopeful and scientifically grounded, with a minimal interface that prioritizes data clarity over visual complexity.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using earth-friendly greens paired with energy-efficient blues to communicate environmental purpose while maintaining professional developer tool aesthetics.

- **Primary Color**: Forest Green (oklch(0.45 0.15 142)) - Communicates environmental focus and growth
- **Secondary Colors**: Clean Blue (oklch(0.55 0.12 240)) for technical elements, Warm Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 85)) for supporting content
- **Accent Color**: Bright Lime (oklch(0.75 0.18 130)) for call-to-action elements and positive impact metrics
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 21:1 ✓
  - Primary (Forest Green oklch(0.45 0.15 142)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Clean Blue oklch(0.55 0.12 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Lime oklch(0.75 0.18 130)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey technical precision with environmental mindfulness - using clean, readable fonts that work well for both code snippets and impact metrics.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Metric Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter spacing
  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code (Snippets): JetBrains Mono Regular/14px/monospace spacing
  - Metrics (Numbers): Inter SemiBold/20px/tabular numbers

## Animations

Subtle functionality with purposeful environmental metaphors - gentle transitions that reinforce the app's eco-friendly mission without overwhelming the technical content.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Growth animations for positive metrics, flowing transitions between analysis steps, and subtle energy-saving visual cues
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Analysis progress gets primary animation focus, metric counters animate on reveal, suggestion cards have gentle hover states
